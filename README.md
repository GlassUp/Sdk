Glassup SDK for Android lets you write beautiful GlassUp  applications completely in Java.

## What is GlassUp

With GlassUp you can control your apps directly from your glasses. Messages and notifications are shown for only a few instants, on the side of the field of view, in an unobtrusive manner.
They work via a bluetooth connection and a set of apps (Android, iOS, hopefully Windows), depending on the mobile platform and the message you want to receive, so you must have your mobile with you. They are read only, we believe it would be messy to try and manage the messages: to respond to a message you’ll have to go back to your mobile, as usual.
